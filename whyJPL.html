        <b1>Lets get in to some examples and what I believe to be the right strategies to employ for serious players in order to start winning at cornhole. Remember: these winning cornhole strategies could be exactly what you need to elevate your game to the Next level.

            Example 1) Red threw first and laid up the perfect block. As a beginner player your number one option is to double block ( throwing your bag right in front of the red one). It causes the player you are throwing against to make a decision. Is he/she content throwing for a wash or does he/she want to start throwing airmails? The risks are low for the double block. If you miss left or right, it is still 1-1.
            
            If the other player goes for an airmail and misses, you gave yourself a point. The best airmailers in the world are around 70% accurate. So even if you are playing elite talent, you still have a 30% chance of making a point. Most average players are under 50%.
            
            Can we start putting pickles on the menu, even if they are served “on the side”.
            
            I don't understand why we've just decided as a society that pickles are an okay thing to just give someone with absolutely no warning.
            
            Every menu says when sandwiches come with a side of chips, but they never say a word about the pickle. I don’t want to be slipped a pickle.</b1>
